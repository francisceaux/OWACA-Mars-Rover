Our project for this semester is to create the control circuitry for a Mars Rover. The rover will include the following features:  
● Power will be individually controlled through each wheel. 
The rover will be able to move forwards and backwards or turn by varying the power in each wheel. 
● The Rover should be able to receive and understand instructions and data via a satellite connection. 
● The rover should be able to take and store pictures of Mars. 
● Scientists require further information on Martian soil. 
When collecting this data, the soil’s pH level and elemental makeup should be saved. 
● Temperature reading, and be able to convert the temperature to Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.  
● The pictures, soil readings, and temperature readings should be sent by the rover to Mission Control through a satellite connection in addition to the on-board storage. 
● It is critical that the robot’s battery percentage be closely monitored. 
If the battery falls too low, the rover must be able to recharge itself using its solar panels. 
While charging, the rover should cease all other functions. 
● The robot must be able to move from its current location to a given set of coordinates. 
● In addition, error states will exist for sensor failures or adverse conditions, such as when the temperature gets too hot or too cold.  
● If an error does not clear, the rover should enter a standby mode and communicate with Mission Control about the situation until it is resolved. 
● In true Rover fashion, the ability to sing “Happy Birthday” is required. The rover will “hum  (beep) the song in the right pitch. 
● Such a system will require to be able to do both math and logic and to handle error states.
